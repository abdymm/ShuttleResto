## Code Style Guide

### Shortcut import with Babel (Modul Resolver)

All babel configuration can found on `babel.config.js` and `tsconfig.js` file.

```javascript
// Don't
import {SomeComponents} from '../../common/components';

// Do
import {SomeComponents} from '@Components';
```

### Pattern and Project Structure

iam using **Domain Driven Design** in this app for project/folder structure, this can be apply for modular apps and this architecture can be optimised for large scale apps.

`/common` for all common/universal things that can be used everywhere in the project (eg. components)
`/feature` will consist every each of module/feature that we have on the app (eg. Restaurant)

#### Project Structure

`/common`
`/components` for generic/universal components will be in here, eg. Text
`/constants` for constants variable eg. Metrics
`/hooks` for custom hooks
`/navigations` all related to the react navigation and Routing
`/services` for API or remote call
`/stores` state management eg. Redux
`/types` for all types
`/utils` utility eg. String, Date, etc
`/features`
`/Home` this is the Search page or the entry point of the app
`/Profile` Profile page that will show profile data and setting menu
`/components` components that being used in Profile screen
`/screens` list of page or main screen
`/Restaurant` List of restaurant and detail of it (restaurant menus)
`/components` components that being used in Restaurant page and detail Restaurant Eg. Item and MenuItem
`/model` Rematch model for Restaurant state
`/screens` list of page or main screen of Restaurant
